I'll be on IRC soon. 

Things are looking down, not referring to the project, but everything else, which is what 
has affected my ability to do anything, sorry about that. What I committed here functioned
 on my computer, but I dont have time to write a list of what I did, we will talk on IRC soon. 
I hope you didn't lose faith, or are angry, Ill let you know what has happened soon.  Tomorrow 
I must go to the university and understand why I didnt get in, then try to get in ( pull strings ),
 and do what I can to begin studying. Slight possibility ill just go back to the USA, but I am 
trying to avoid that. -Shepherd

Some things that were done
Move configuration files to data/config
Learnt about CEGUI and incorporated fully with some custom made imageset stuff, CEGUI will search for all its resources in the data directory now
Implemented gamestates, there are four states currently, the splash screen; main menu; settings menu ( which in the future can be done inside the mainmenu without changing states, but simply by showing and hiding widgets; and the testing state which loads the ogre scene you create with the zombie, etc. 
BaseApp.cpp/.h is not necessary anymore, as the states implementation is responsible for managing that stuff now
maybe there are some other things, but I have forgotten. Some code and stuff is ugly and messy, for example the fading, which is not limited by miliseconds.
