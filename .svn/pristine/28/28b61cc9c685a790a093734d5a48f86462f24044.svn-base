Sat 11 Jun 2011 First commit.

Compiles, nothing is finished.
Use the ogre pps found on the download section of the ogre website.

Don't expect anything to work, nothing does. Except the client, which renders the ogre head.

Obviously, there's a lot of work to be done.


Server:
Impliment zlib
Load archives
Read files from archives
Load heightmaps from images in archives
Load building zones from images in archives - and re-use the same every time.
Load strees from image in archives
Load start area(s) from image in archives
Load zombie levels from image in archives
	We could simply exploit the 0-255 nature of greyscale, black(0) = level 0 zombies (none), white(255) = toughest level 255 zombies
Load static zombies from greyscale images and a txt file to override the colers.

if we could paint, walls and floors. from greyscale images ?adding extra dimensional information automatically? that would be money. We could use this as a base to generate furniture and doodads.

Methods to add/remove players that load charactor from database
Login & register functions that log into a database

client:
load welcome animation
settings, login, register, quit on first screen.

Esc key always moves back on menus.
